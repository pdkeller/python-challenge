# This folder contains two folders titled PyBank and PyPoll. Each of these folders contain a file titled main.py and two folders titled Analysis and Resources. The Resources folder contains the csv data that is read by the main.py file. The Analysis folder contains a summary of the data printed to terminal during the main.py execution.

# During this project, I followed examples from the class repositories as well as links supplied by the instructors. I also received some tutoring help from Fred Logan who helped me with the output file into the Analysis folder for each code.
